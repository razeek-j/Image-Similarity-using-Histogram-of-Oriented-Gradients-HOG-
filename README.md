# Image-Similarity-using-Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients-HOG-
This repository contains a Python script that implements the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm to create a feature vector, or "fingerprint," for images. It then uses these fingerprints to calculate the structural similarity between two images using cosine similarity.
